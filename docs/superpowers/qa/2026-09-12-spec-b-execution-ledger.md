# Spec B execution ledger — business settings and policies

## Provenance and authorization

- Application base: `8d2f897154526037606e9fee60f4b9a606089e8a` (`origin/master` at preparation).
- Approved documentation / implementation initial HEAD: `c4c020fa209d1bb2cb850bd59654af5dfca60134`.
- Worktree: `C:/Projetos/sistema-para-delivery-spec-b-settings-policies`.
- Branch: `feature/spec-b-settings-policies`.
- Round 1 authorization is limited to T01, T02 and T03.
- T04 is not authorized and remains the next unauthorized task.
- Commits and push are authorized only on `feature/spec-b-settings-policies`; no push was performed in T01 or its correction round.
- Merge, staging/production deploy and remote migrations remain unauthorized.

## Preparation baseline

The controller prepared the isolated worktree and recorded the following real baseline before T01:

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm ci` | Exit 0; 50 packages installed; 0 vulnerabilities. |
| `npm run lint` | Exit 0 with pre-existing warnings. |
| `npm run build` | Exit 0 with pre-existing chunk/plugin timing warnings. |
| `npm test` | Hundreds of tests passed, but the process stopped producing output and was interrupted after several minutes; this is not accepted as T01 RED. |

## T01 — typed contracts, defaults and characterization

Status: implemented in the commit containing this ledger, with subject `feat: define typed business policy contracts`.

### Characterization before new contracts

Command:

```text
node --test shared/orderTiming.test.js src/utils/orderWorkflow.test.js worker/validation.test.js shared/orderCustomerIdentity.test.js worker/orderCustomerIdentityCheckout.test.js worker/orderAutomaticPrintJob.test.js
```

Result: exit 0; 54/54 passed. This pins exact immediate 30/40-minute boundaries, scheduled exact/15-minute behavior, monetary rounding, Local table identity and existing one/two-copy behavior.

### RED

Initial discovery run exited 1 because the two new modules did not exist. Minimal export-only stubs were then added so the accepted behavioral RED was not a module-resolution failure.

Command:

```text
node --test shared/businessPolicies.test.js shared/settingsCatalogs.test.js
```

Accepted RED result: exit 1; 0/10 passed. Assertions failed for empty defaults, missing range/key/default validation, absent historical payment mapping, empty native catalogs, missing label normalization and missing catalog invariants.

### GREEN

Command:

```text
node --test shared/businessPolicies.test.js shared/settingsCatalogs.test.js
```

Result: exit 0; 10/10 passed. A later fresh run after boundary additions also exited 0 with 10/10 passed.

### Verification and regression evidence

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm.cmd run lint` | Exit 0; only warnings already present outside T01 paths. |
| `npm.cmd run build` | Exit 0; 369 modules transformed; existing large-chunk warning. The first sandboxed attempt hit `EPERM` in `node_modules/.vite-temp`; the authorized local rerun passed. |
| Full `npm.cmd test` outside sandbox | Completed in 57.3 s; 1,199/1,200 passed. One pre-existing failure remained: `src/pages/FinanceMoreMobile.test.js`, test “more menu keeps only approved direct destinations and touch-friendly actions”. Both that test and `src/components/MobileNavigation.jsx` have no diff from `origin/master`. The previously recorded hang did not reproduce. |
| Focused contracts + characterization rerun | Exit 0; 64/64 passed. |
| `git diff --check` / staged diff review | Exit 0 with no whitespace errors; staged patch reviewed and limited to the six explicit T01 paths. |

### Review and blockers

- Self-review: contracts and tests checked against the T01 brief and canonical shapes 3.1; no operational consumer, endpoint, migration or UI file changed.
- Independent review: pending controller review.
- Blocker for T01: none.
- Known repository concern: one unrelated pre-existing full-suite assertion failure described above.

## Task progression

- [x] T01 — typed contracts, defaults and characterization.
- [ ] T02 — migrations and compatible seeds (authorized, not started here).
- [ ] T03 — atomic operations repository (authorized, not started here).
- [ ] T04 — payment policy repository (not authorized; do not start).

## T01 correction — Fix round 1

Base commit: `a681e0a3ad195f52593668e3b956a1e70ff2ad56` (`feat: define typed business policy contracts`). The correction is the commit containing this ledger, with subject `fix: preserve settings catalog invariants`.

Scope was limited to review findings in the shared catalog contract and this authorization record. No migration, endpoint, UI, operational consumer or later task was changed.

### RED

Command:

```text
node --test shared/settingsCatalogs.test.js
```

Result before the correction: exit 1; 4/10 passed and 6/10 failed. The failures proved that native cancellation items lacked immutable `requiresNote` metadata, trusted `existing` usage/tombstone metadata did not preserve custom identities for either catalog kind, and the automatic finance IDs `sales`/`refunds` were not reserved.

Each added assertion detects a concrete weakening: removal/change of native `requiresNote`, acceptance of forged editable metadata, rename or omission after use, tombstone ID/name recreation, or reuse of either automatic identity.

### GREEN and regression evidence

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| `node --test shared/settingsCatalogs.test.js` | Exit 0; 10/10 passed. |
| Contracts plus selected characterizations | Exit 0; 69/69 passed. |
| `npm.cmd run lint` | Exit 0; only the pre-existing warnings outside T01 paths. |
| `git diff --check` | Exit 0; no whitespace errors. |
| Staged diff review | Exactly the ledger, catalog contract and catalog test; `git diff --cached --check` exited 0. |

### Review state

- Self-review: source, tests, ledger and final staged patch reviewed against all four findings; no out-of-scope path is staged.
- Initial independent review: three Important findings, covering native `requiresNote`, custom-item permanence from trusted `existing` metadata, and reservation of automatic finance IDs.
- Fix round 1: committed as `a18e5650f9155c18f8b169720feb4819215cf642` (`fix: preserve settings catalog invariants`).
- Independent re-review: all three Important findings addressed; no new Critical or Important findings.
- Deferred Minor: the mutable `Set` returned by `settingsGrants` remains intentionally deferred to the final review and was not expanded into this correction.
- T01 status: completed, review clean for Critical/Important severity.
- T02/T03 were not started; T04 remains unauthorized.

### Next authorized task

- T02 is the next authorized task and has not been started.
- T04 remains unauthorized.
- No push was performed as part of this bookkeeping closure.
